1) What does the code do in each section of the program
    -Importing libraries
    -namespace foldername (file directory)
    -class name of the program/file
    -Start of main program (static and void are protocols)
    -variable dictionary list/initiating values (potentially functions)
    -console.
        -writeline (program prints)
        -write     (program prints expecting return)
        -readline  (accepts input and applies value to variable)
2) What is the overall goal of the program?
    Allow the user to do math/works like a calculator
3) Do you see issues with the program?
    The code for multiply is missing.
4) Do you have questions about the program?

5) Can you test out your questions (#4) by creating an educated guess, then make changes to the code that test your educated guess?

6) Please generated solutions to the issues (#3) in the program and incorporated them in the program to fix it.
    Placed in the switch function
        case "Multiply":
            intResult = int1 * intNum2;
            break;
    Placed in the Double function
        else if (strOperand == "Multiply")
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"\n\nThe product of {intNum1} and {intNum2}equals: {dblResult}");
        }
